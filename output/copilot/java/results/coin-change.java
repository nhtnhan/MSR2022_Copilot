/** https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/ */
//You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
//Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
//You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
