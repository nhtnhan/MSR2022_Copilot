/** https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/ */
//An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
//For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
//Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.
//A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {

                count++;
