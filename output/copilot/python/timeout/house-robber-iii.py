# https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/
#The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
#Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
#Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

#         self.right = right
